# Third-Party Library Code

This folder contains files which are borrowed wholesale from other projects. These generally should be self-contained components of complex packages: if we require a complex set of interrelated tools then a traditional NPM dependency is preferred, and copying the code into our project only makes sense if that dependency would bring along too many unrelated modules & dependencies.
